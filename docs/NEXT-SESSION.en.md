# Where to pick up

The state of the project at the close of the second session of **2026-08-10**, the one that settled
the legal debt. The Spanish version is in [NEXT-SESSION.es.md](NEXT-SESSION.es.md). The canonical
scope record is still [FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md); the audit's outstanding work lives in
[2026-08-08-audit-remediation.md](superpowers/plans/2026-08-08-audit-remediation.md). This is only the
place to resume from.

## Startup check

```powershell
$env:DOTNET_ROOT="$env:USERPROFILE\.dotnet"; $env:PATH="$env:DOTNET_ROOT;$env:PATH"
dotnet --version                                        # 10.0.302
git status --short --branch                             # clean, on origin/codex/ap-reelume-mvp-x64
git merge-base --is-ancestor main HEAD; $LASTEXITCODE   # 0
```

## Where the code lives now

`apvisualsolutions/ap-reelume` has been **public** since 2026-08-10, as a fresh cut with a single root
commit. The full development history stayed in `apvisualsolutions/ap-reelume-archive` (private), so
**the SHAs the evidence documents cite resolve there, not here**. The local remotes are `origin`
(public) and `archive` (the history), and the old branches are kept as `archived/main` and
`archived/codex/…` pointing at the archive.

CI runs on hosted runners, free for public repositories. The self-hosted runner is still installed
under `.runner/` (git-ignored) but **switched off**, and the workflow has no way to call it.

## What this session finished

Four commits, each with its full cycle and its bilingual evidence.

- **The artifact delivers the licences it names.** It was the one open legal breach. `licenses/`,
  inside both artifacts, carries the five canonical texts — LGPL-2.1, GPL-2.0, Apache-2.0, MIT,
  BSD-3-Clause — and the copyright notices of ANGLE, SkiaSharp, HarfBuzzSharp, BouncyCastle, SQLite,
  SQLitePCLRaw and VideoLAN: fifteen files, 209 KiB. The Skia and HarfBuzz native notice turned up
  **twenty-odd libraries** that `libSkiaSharp.dll` carries — freetype, ICU, libpng, libwebp, zlib —
  and that appeared in no project document. Nothing is transcribed: `LicenceTextTests` compares every
  copy byte for byte against the NuGet package the build consumed, and reads every copyright out of
  the restored `.nuspec`. Detail in
  [audit-legal-licence-texts.md](evidence/stable/audit-legal-licence-texts.md).
- **TMDB's logo is in Credits**, which closes the last open point of their terms. The file is the one
  TMDB publishes and that can be shown: the SHA-256 they embed in the asset's address matches the
  versioned file's. They publish SVG only and Avalonia draws no SVG, so the view carries the file's
  geometry — a test compares the two character for character — rather than pulling in a renderer and
  half a dozen packages with their licences. The specification said 24 px against a 48 px product
  name; that 48 existed in no view, so it was measured and settled at 16 against 24. Detail in
  [audit-legal-tmdb-logo.md](evidence/stable/audit-legal-tmdb-logo.md).
- **ARQ-001 / WIN-005 / the rest of BUG-004.** The service provider has an owner and is released on
  exit; `PendingActivationPath` and the playback session's state left the statics.
  `DisableParallelization` came off `AssembledShellSuites` and the seventy accessibility tests pass
  without it, which is the proof the ownership is real. `WindowLifecycle` was extracted, the coverage
  gate put it at 70.89% of lines and 28.57% of branches, and it **went back**, like
  `WindowsFilePickers` before it. Detail in
  [audit-arq001-application-host.md](evidence/stable/audit-arq001-application-host.md).
- **Continuous integration went quiet for an hour at a time.** Six of this session's ten runs died at
  the sixty-minute ceiling, with the log silent from "build succeeded" to the cancellation fifty-six
  minutes later. The step after it, `eng/generate-test-media.ps1`, started FFmpeg with no bound.
  Every call now has a ceiling, every sample is announced before it is produced, and a test with an
  encoder that never returns checks that the script dies in seconds naming the recipe. Producing the
  whole matrix costs a measured 1.6 s, so the ceiling is not a performance budget.
- **The two hardenings the audit filed as "not exploitable".** One was far less so than noted: the
  external launcher handed the Windows shell a `.ps1`, a `.txt` and a file with no extension. The
  other did not exist in the form described, and that was only learned by forging the archive that
  would have exploited it. Detail in
  [audit-hardening-launcher-and-restore.md](evidence/stable/audit-hardening-launcher-and-restore.md).

## What comes next (in this order)

1. **ARQ-004**: a single `AsyncRelayCommand` with error handling — there are some twenty-four
   unguarded `async void` methods and coverage across view models is uneven — plus global
   `UnhandledException` and `UnobservedTaskException` handlers in `Program.cs`.
2. **ARQ-005**: startup without `GetAwaiter().GetResult()` on the interface thread (migration and
   integrity), and taking the blocking call out of the `lock` in `WindowsMediaKeyService`.
3. **ARQ-010**: `ValidateOnBuild = true`.
4. **The coverage debt** named in
   [TST1-coverage-gate.md](evidence/stable/TST1-coverage-gate.md): the error branches of
   `ReconcileScannedFiles`, `CompositeFileIdentityProvider` and `PlayerVersionsViewModel`. It stays
   debt on purpose: it is settled when that area is touched, and this session did not touch it.

## Yours (only what an agent cannot do)

- **Add the `RELEASE_SIGNING_SECRET_KEY` secret to the public repository.** It could not be copied —
  secrets cannot be read — and **without it the publishing pipeline fails on purpose**: `release.yml`
  checks that `SHA256SUMS.txt.minisig` exists and verifies, and stops if it does not. It is the only
  thing between the project and cutting its first public release. The copy is where you left it (see
  `SECURITY.md`).
- The **manual ten-minute physical walk**
  ([audit-physical-walk.md](evidence/stable/audit-physical-walk.md)).
- The **encrypted backup** of the signing key.
- **The export notification** to `crypt@bis.doc.gov` and `enc@nsa.gov`: the text is drafted in full in
  [LEGAL.en.md](legal/LEGAL.en.md) and goes from your identity, which is why it is yours.
- **The professional legal opinion** (`REL-004`). Two concrete licence questions are left for it, and
  both are about form rather than delivery: which subsection of LGPL-2.1 §6 covers the way LibVLC
  travels here, and whether the written offer of corresponding source recorded in
  `NOTICE-VideoLAN.txt` is enough as the accompaniment GPL-2.0 §3 asks for.
- The usual economic decisions: Authenticode certificate, Store, ARM64 hardware.

## Things learned worth not learning twice

- **The coverage gate reads from `HEAD`, not from disk.** With new files only staged it announces "no
  new file" and exits green. Commit and re-run `eng/check-coverage.ps1` **before** pushing, or CI will
  be the one to find the red.
- **A finding filed as "not exploitable" is a finding that was never measured.** Of the two the audit
  left noted, one was a direct hand-off to the Windows shell and the other did not exist. Neither was
  known until the test that would have exploited it was written.
- **A test that passes before the fix is not good news**, it is the hypothesis announcing it was
  wrong. That is where to stop and measure again.
- **`eng/verify-package.ps1` compares two clean checkouts**, so it refuses to run with unstaged files.
  A `git add -A` before `eng/verify.ps1` saves half an hour.
- **A class comes out when its tests can follow it**, and the coverage gate decides that, not
  intuition. `WindowLifecycle` compiled and the assembled walks were green; it went back anyway, like
  `WindowsFilePickers` before it.
- **The tests that read the composition as text break every time something moves.** Three times now.
  When code leaves `CompositionRoot`, updating `CompositionSourceText` and `CompositionGraph` is part
  of the move, not a fix afterwards.
